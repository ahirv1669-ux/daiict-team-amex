# 🌱 Blockchain-Based Green Hydrogen Credit System  
*A Hackout’25 Project by Team Amex*

## 📌 Problem Statement  
In the transition to low-carbon economies, there is **no trusted way to prove hydrogen is truly “green.”**  
Current challenges include:  
- Fraud or double counting of credits  
- Lack of transparency between producers, buyers, and regulators  
- Weak links with auditors & government checkers  

## Our Solution  
We built a **Blockchain-Based Green Hydrogen Credit System** where:  
- Every unit of certified green hydrogen is **issued as a blockchain credit**.  
- **Smart Contracts** ensure no fraud or double counting.  
- A **real-time dashboard** enables producers, buyers, regulators, and auditors to track credits seamlessly.  
- **IoT/Drones** feed production & site data for transparency.  
- **Auditors & Government agencies** can verify and monitor compliance.  

 **Outcome**: A trusted, transparent, and tamper-proof ecosystem that boosts confidence in green hydrogen markets.  

## 🏗️ System Architecture
Data Sources (IoT, Drones, Sensors)

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites  
- Node.js (>= 18)  
- npm / yarn  
- MongoDB or PostgreSQL running  
- MetaMask wallet + Testnet (e.g., Sepolia)  
- Hardhat/Foundry for smart contract deployment  

### 2️⃣ Clone Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahirv1669-ux/daiict-team-amex.git
cd daiict-team-amex

# Frontend
npm install

# Backend
cd backend
npm install

### Create .env.local (frontend) and .env (backend):

Frontend (.env.local):

NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourContract
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

Backend (.env):
PORT=5000
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/greenhydrogen
RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourContract
JWT_SECRET=supersecret

## run project :
# Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Frontend
cd ..
npm run dev

Now visit → http://localhost:3000 🎉
